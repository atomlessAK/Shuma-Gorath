# 🐙 Configuration

Shuma-Gorath uses one runtime configuration model:

- Tunables are stored in KV under `config:<site_id>` (default `config:default`).
- Env vars are reserved for secrets and runtime guardrails.
- `config/defaults.env` is the canonical source for defaults (no hidden tunable defaults in Rust).

## 🐙 Startup Model

`make setup`:

1. Creates `.env.local` from `config/defaults.env` if missing.
2. Generates local dev secrets in `.env.local` (`SHUMA_API_KEY`, `SHUMA_JS_SECRET`, `SHUMA_FORWARDED_IP_SECRET`).
3. Runs `make config-seed`, which writes KV tunables only when `config:default` does not already exist.
4. Normalizes `.env.local` entries to unquoted `KEY=value` style for consistency.

At runtime:

- Tunables are loaded from KV.
- Env-only keys are loaded from process env.
- Missing/invalid KV config returns `500 Configuration unavailable` for config-dependent requests.

## 🐙 Runtime Config Cache

- KV-backed runtime config is cached in-process for a short TTL (currently 2 seconds).
- `POST /admin/config` invalidates the cache on the handling instance immediately after a successful KV write.
- In multi-instance deployments, other instances refresh on their own TTL window, so brief config staleness (up to TTL) is expected.

## 🐙 Canonical Variable Reference

Reference files:

- `config/defaults.env` (all defaults)
- `.env.local` (generated by `make setup`; env-only override source, gitignored)

## 🐙 Admin Config Writes

- `GET /admin/config` reads effective KV-backed config.
- `POST /admin/config` writes to KV only when `SHUMA_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=true`.
- Successful writes invalidate runtime config cache on the instance that processed the request.
- KV writes persist across restarts.

## 🐙 JS Verification + PoW

- `js_required_enforced=true` routes visitors without a valid `js_verified` cookie to JS verification.
- `pow_enabled=true` adds server-verified PoW to that verification flow.
- `js_required_enforced=false` bypasses JS verification for normal requests (and therefore bypasses PoW on that path).

## 🐙 Composability Modes (`off`/`signal`/`enforce`/`both`)

Mode semantics for eligible modules (`rate`, `geo`, `js`):

- `off`: no scored signal contribution and no enforcement action.
- `signal`: contribute scored signal only; no direct enforcement action.
- `enforce`: allow direct enforcement path only; no scored contribution.
- `both`: enable both scored contribution and enforcement path.

Default seeded modes are `both` for all three modules as the current pre-launch baseline (`rate=both`, `geo=both`, `js=both`).

### Effective mode notes and invalid combinations

- `js_required_enforced` is still a hard gate for JS paths.
- When `js_required_enforced=false`, JS signal and JS enforcement are both effectively disabled even if `defence_modes.js` is `signal`, `enforce`, or `both`.
- `/admin/config` surfaces this as:
  - `defence_modes` (configured modes),
  - `defence_modes_effective` (runtime-effective signal/action booleans),
  - `defence_mode_warnings` (configuration conflict notes).

### Tuning implications

- `rate=signal` keeps botness pressure scoring without rate-limit bans; useful for dry-run tuning.
- `rate=enforce` keeps hard caps/bans but removes rate pressure from botness scoring.
- `geo=signal` keeps GEO risk scoring while deferring GEO routing actions (`block/challenge/maze`) to other controls.
- `geo=enforce` keeps explicit GEO routing actions but removes GEO contribution to botness score.
- `js=signal` or `js=enforce` still require `js_required_enforced=true`; otherwise JS signal/action are both effectively disabled.

## 🐙 Provider Selection (H4 foundation)

- Provider selection is now explicit in config under `provider_backends`.
- All capabilities default to `internal`.
- `external` backend behavior in the current slice:
  - `fingerprint_signal=external` routes to an explicit external stub contract (`/fingerprint-report`) with no injected detection script and `501` report handler response until a concrete adapter is configured.
  - Fingerprint source availability is explicit:
    - internal provider reports `active` when `cdp_detection_enabled=true`, `disabled` when `cdp_detection_enabled=false`.
    - external stub reports `unavailable` when `cdp_detection_enabled=true`, `disabled` when `cdp_detection_enabled=false`.
  - `rate_limiter=external`, `ban_store=external`, `challenge_engine=external`, and `maze_tarpit=external` route through explicit unsupported external adapters that currently fall back to internal runtime behavior.
  - `ban_store` external sync methods currently return `failed` to surface unimplemented external sync semantics.
- `edge_integration_mode` defaults to `off` for self-hosted baseline.
- `advisory` and `authoritative` are currently telemetry/runtime metadata posture values in this slice; request decision precedence remains unchanged.

### Provider + Edge Matrix (Operator Quick Reference)

This matrix is meant to answer: "What actually happens if I change this setting?"

| Capability | `internal` backend | `external` backend (current) | Advisory mode intent | Authoritative mode intent | Safe fallback behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fingerprint_signal` | Uses internal CDP scripts and `/cdp-report` | Uses external stub (`/fingerprint-report`), no detection injection, returns `501` on report handler | Treat external edge fingerprinting as an input to Shuma policy | Allow selected edge fingerprint outcomes to short-circuit local flow only after adapter hardening | If external is unavailable, treat signal as unavailable/disabled and keep local controls active |
| `rate_limiter` | Internal local rate logic | Explicit unsupported external adapter currently delegates to internal behavior | Consume distributed rate state as advisory pressure once implemented | External authoritative limit decisions only after semantic parity is proven | Unsupported external path currently degrades to internal behavior |
| `ban_store` | Internal ban persistence and checks | Explicit unsupported external adapter currently delegates to internal checks; sync calls report `failed` | Use external ban sync state as advisory input once implemented | External authoritative ban sync only with explicit outage controls | Unsupported external path keeps internal enforcement active |
| `challenge_engine` | Internal challenge rendering/verification | Explicit unsupported external adapter currently delegates to internal behavior | External challenge attestations may inform policy once implemented | Authoritative external challenge only when replay/expiry semantics are parity-tested | Unsupported external path keeps internal challenge path |
| `maze_tarpit` | Internal Shuma-native maze/tarpit | Explicit unsupported external adapter delegates to internal behavior | Keep internal (no practical external target currently) | Keep internal | Internal-only path remains the source of truth |
| Policy composition (`botness`, routing, modes) | Internal | Not externalized | Shuma remains policy brain | Shuma remains policy brain | Not swappable by design |

### Recommended Config Profiles

Use these as startup presets, then tune incrementally:

1. `self_hosted_minimal`:
   - all `SHUMA_PROVIDER_*` values = `internal`
   - `SHUMA_EDGE_INTEGRATION_MODE=off`
2. `enterprise_akamai` (advisory-first):
   - begin with all providers `internal`
   - enable one external provider at a time only after staging soak
   - set `SHUMA_EDGE_INTEGRATION_MODE=advisory` during initial enterprise rollout
3. `enterprise_akamai` (authoritative-optional):
   - only after advisory stability and rollback rehearsal
   - keep non-validated capabilities on `internal`
   - set `SHUMA_EDGE_INTEGRATION_MODE=authoritative` only for validated integrations

### Observability surfaces for composability

- `/metrics` includes:
  - `bot_defence_botness_signal_state_total{signal="...",state="active|disabled|unavailable"}`
  - `bot_defence_defence_mode_effective_total{module="rate|geo|js",configured="off|signal|enforce|both",signal_enabled="true|false",action_enabled="true|false"}`
  - `bot_defence_edge_integration_mode_total{mode="off|advisory|authoritative"}`
  - `bot_defence_provider_implementation_effective_total{capability="...",backend="internal|external",implementation="..."}`
- Botness-driven maze/challenge event outcomes include both:
  - `signal_states` summary (`key:state:contribution`),
  - effective runtime metadata summary (`modes=... edge=...`),
  - provider summary (`providers=capability=backend/implementation ...`).

## 🐙 GEO Trust Boundary

GEO/proto headers are trusted only when:

- `SHUMA_FORWARDED_IP_SECRET` is configured, and
- request includes matching `X-Shuma-Forwarded-Secret`.

Without trust, forwarded IP/proto/GEO-derived routing and GEO scoring are skipped.
