# 🐙 Dashboard Documentation

## 🐙 Overview

The dashboard provides real-time monitoring, analytics, and admin controls for Shuma-Gorath.

## 🐙 Tabbed SPA Layout

The dashboard is now organized as a tabbed SPA with URL-backed hash routes:

- `#monitoring`
- `#ip-bans`
- `#status`
- `#config`
- `#tuning`

Behavior:
- Selected tab is reflected in the URL hash.
- Reload preserves the selected tab.
- Keyboard navigation is supported on tabs (`Left`, `Right`, `Home`, `End`).
- Tab panels expose explicit loading/empty/error states.

Refresh model:
- Polling is scoped to the active tab only.
- One bounded timer is used (no per-tab timer accumulation).
- Polling pauses while the page is hidden and resumes on visibility restore.
- Auto-refresh defaults to `OFF` and is explicitly user-toggled.
- Auto-refresh is only available on `Monitoring` and `IP Bans` (cadence `60s`).
- `Status`/`Config`/`Tuning` refresh on page-load bootstrap and explicit config/tuning save flows (no background polling).
- Monitoring and IP-ban snapshots are cached in local storage with a short TTL (`60s`) to reduce repeated API load/cost on quick remount/tab revisit paths.
- Cached monitoring payloads are compacted before storage (bounded recent events/CDP rows/ban rows) to reduce serialization and local-storage overhead.
- Logout/session-expiry clears monitoring/IP-ban local cache keys to avoid telemetry bleed across session boundaries.
- Dashboard API requests now apply a client timeout guard (`12s` default) so stalled admin endpoints fail fast instead of hanging polling/refresh cycles indefinitely.
- Monitoring refresh uses a single consolidated read (`/admin/monitoring`) and now updates all monitoring sections from equally fresh snapshot state (cards, tables, and charts).
- Monitoring long-range (`7d`/`30d`) range reads stay explicit user-driven in manual mode and only run on bounded cadence while auto-refresh is enabled.
- Monitoring events/CDP tables now use keyed row patching with bounded row windows (`events<=100`, `cdp<=500`) to avoid full-table DOM rebuild churn on refresh.
- Monitoring summary/trend rendering now applies bounded sanitization before chart/table paint (top-list rows capped at `10`, trend points capped at `720`, range-event fetch rows capped at `5000`, non-finite/negative counts coerced to safe bounded integers).
- Monitoring long-range (`7d`/`30d`) fetches now abort when the tab becomes inactive and apply a dedicated fetch timeout (`10s`) to avoid background request churn.
- Runtime telemetry now captures:
- refresh fetch latency (last/rolling avg/p95/max over a bounded sample window),
- render timing to next frame (last/rolling avg/p95/max over a bounded sample window),
- polling skip/resume counters and last skip/resume reasons.

## 🐙 SvelteKit Runtime

- Dashboard UI is now generated by SvelteKit (`adapter-static`) and served from `dist/dashboard`.
- Route contracts are preserved:
- `/dashboard/index.html`
- `/dashboard/login.html`
- Existing tab hash routes (`#monitoring`, `#ip-bans`, `#status`, `#config`, `#tuning`).
- The page is now a Svelte component tree (`Monitoring`, `IP Bans`, `Status`, `Config`, `Tuning`) instead of shell-fragment injection.
- Runtime behavior mounts directly through `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-native-runtime.js` (`mountDashboardApp`/`unmountDashboardApp`) with explicit lifecycle cleanup.
- Svelte-native orchestration is route-local through `src/routes/+page.svelte` + `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-route-controller.js` (hash sync, polling cadence, visibility pause/resume, session bootstrap/logout, and keyboard tab focus) with `src/lib/state/dashboard-store.js` as the single state source.
- Refresh orchestration and tab-state message transitions are centralized in `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-runtime-refresh.js`.
- `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-native-runtime.js` is now a slim runtime boundary for session restore/logout, snapshot refresh wiring, and domain API mutations (config save, ban/unban, robots preview) with no per-field DOM mutation layer.
- Config, tuning, and IP-ban workflows are now component-local Svelte state with explicit callback props and declarative dirty/validation/submit behavior.
- Chart runtime lifecycle is module-scoped through `src/lib/domain/services/chart-runtime-adapter.js` (lazy load, singleton guard, teardown on final unmount) instead of static head-script injection.
- `dashboard/package.json` still sets `"type": "module"` so existing dashboard module unit tests run via native ESM in Node.

## 🐙 Features

Stats:
- Total bans
- Active bans
- Total events
- Unique IPs
- Test mode banner
- Fail-open/closed indicator (read-only)

Charts:
- Event types distribution (doughnut)
- Top IPs by activity (bar)
- Events over time (line, 60m/24h/7d/30d)
- Local chart runtime renders legends and readable axes/ticks (no CDN dependency)

Tables:
- Current bans (IP, reason, timestamps, signal badges, expandable fingerprint details, quick unban)
- Recent events (type, IP, timestamp, reason)
- CDP detections & bans table (time-windowed CDP-only feed)
- CDP cumulative totals (all-time detections + auto-bans)
- Monitoring summaries:
- Honeypot Hits (total hits, unique crawler buckets, top crawlers, top paths)
- Challenge Failures (reason breakdown + trend)
- PoW Verification (success/failure outcomes, success ratio, failure reason breakdown + trend)
- Rate Limiting Violations (total, offenders, outcomes)
- GEO Violations (actions + top countries)
- Prometheus helper panel (examples and guidance sourced from `/admin/monitoring` payload as the single contract source, including explicit `/metrics` semantics, `/admin/monitoring?hours=1-720&limit=1-50` bounded-query examples, sample text output, stat-extraction snippets, and copy actions for JS and curl examples with links to observability/API docs)
- Runtime Variable Inventory tables in Status tab:
- full runtime config snapshot (including nested keys)
- grouped by concern for faster operator scanning
- admin-writable variables highlighted with row background
- per-variable meaning text so operators can read value + intent in one place
- Runtime Performance Telemetry panel in Status tab:
- fetch latency and render timing cards (last + rolling avg + p95 + bounded window/total sample counts)
- polling skip/resume counters with last skip reason and resume timestamp
- operator thresholds: keep rolling p95 fetch latency below `500 ms`, rolling p95 render timing below `16 ms`, and investigate sustained polling skip/resume churn.

Controls:
- Test mode toggle
- Manual ban/unban
- Ban IP duration inputs initialize from `ban_durations.admin` (same default source as Ban Durations config)
- JS Required enforcement toggle
- Rate limit (requests/minute) config
- Honeypot controls (`honeypot_enabled`, `honeypots`)
- Browser policy rule editors (`browser_block`, `browser_whitelist`)
- Bypass allowlist editors (`whitelist`, `path_whitelist`)
- Per-trigger ban durations, including CDP automation duration (`ban_durations.cdp`)
- robots.txt configuration

- Enter key submits inputs (API key, ban, unban)
- Active-tab scoped auto-refresh (no background full-dashboard refresh on hidden tabs)
- API client defensively parses JSON-shaped payloads even when upstream omits `Content-Type`, to prevent false empty-state rendering
- Advanced Config JSON editor:
- prefilled with a writable-key template from current config snapshot
- accepts JSON object patch and submits directly to `POST /admin/config`
- dirty-state + validation guarded (save enabled only for valid changed JSON)

## 🐙 Access

Development:
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard/index.html`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard` (canonical redirect to `/dashboard/index.html`)
- Dashboard assets are built via `pnpm run build:dashboard` and emitted to `dist/dashboard` (wired into `make dev`, `make run`, and `make build`).
- API key source: `SHUMA_API_KEY` from environment (local dev commonly loads this from `.env.local`)
- Login flow: unauthenticated visits to `/dashboard/index.html` are redirected to `/dashboard/login.html`; enter API key once to create a short-lived same-origin admin session cookie
- Admin API endpoint is inferred from the page origin (same-origin only)
- `make dev` applies local-write defaults (`DEV_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=true`) even when `.env.local` is stricter.
- `make dev` also clears `SHUMA_ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` by default (`DEV_ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST=`) so localhost browser login works without trusted proxy headers.
- Override dev defaults per run if you want production-like behavior (example: `make dev DEV_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=false DEV_ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST=127.0.0.1,::1`).

Production (recommended):
- Protect the dashboard with auth
- Use `SHUMA_ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` to restrict admin access
- Serve over HTTPS
- Store secrets in your platform’s secret store

## 🐙 Event Retention

Event log retention is controlled by `SHUMA_EVENT_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS` (default: `168`). Set to `0` to disable cleanup.

## 🐙 Data Flow (High Level)

1. SvelteKit renders the dashboard page from `src/routes/+page.svelte` with dedicated tab components.
2. On route mount, `src/routes/+page.svelte` directly calls `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-native-runtime.js` as a single native runtime path (no compatibility flag matrix).
3. Route-local Svelte orchestration in `src/routes/+page.svelte` delegates lifecycle/polling/hash/session coordination to `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-route-controller.js`, using `src/lib/state/dashboard-store.js` for state and telemetry.
4. `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-native-runtime.js` provides lifecycle entrypoints (`mountDashboardApp()` / `unmountDashboardApp()`), auth/session state, and domain API actions without legacy control binding/DOM mutation wiring.
5. Monitoring rendering is Svelte-native (`src/lib/components/dashboard/MonitoringTab.svelte`) with focused subsection components in `src/lib/components/dashboard/monitoring/*.svelte`, consuming snapshot/view-model data from `src/lib/components/dashboard/monitoring-view-model.js`; runtime no longer mutates monitoring DOM by global IDs.
6. Config, tuning, and IP-ban form state/save behavior are Svelte-owned in `src/lib/components/dashboard/ConfigTab.svelte`, `src/lib/components/dashboard/TuningTab.svelte`, and `src/lib/components/dashboard/IpBansTab.svelte`.
7. Login is Svelte-native in `src/routes/login.html/+page.svelte` (no shell injection/bridge).
8. `adapter-static` writes final static assets to `dist/dashboard`, which Spin serves for `/dashboard/...`.

## 🐙 Local Asset Provenance

Chart runtime is vendored locally to avoid runtime CDN dependency and supply-chain variability:

- Asset: `dashboard/static/assets/vendor/chart-lite-1.0.0.min.js`
- Version: `chart-lite-1.0.0`
- SHA-256: `5eec3d4b98e9ddc1fb88c44e0953b8bded137779a4d930c6ab2647a431308388`
- Policy: update only via reviewed commit; recompute SHA-256 and update this section when changed.

## 🐙 Rollback Notes

This is a pre-launch hard cutover: no archived legacy dashboard runtime is retained in-tree.

If a regression appears, use a normal source rollback path (revert offending commit(s), then run `make test` and `make build` before deploy).

Note: `SHUMA_KV_STORE_FAIL_OPEN` is an environment-level policy and is shown read-only in the dashboard.
Note: Admin config panes are editable only when `SHUMA_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=true`.
Note: PoW config changes are logged to the event log as admin actions.
Note: Botness scoring changes are logged as `botness_config_update` admin actions.
