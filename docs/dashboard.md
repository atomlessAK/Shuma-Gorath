# 🐙 Dashboard Documentation

## 🐙 Overview

The dashboard provides real-time monitoring, analytics, and admin controls for Shuma-Gorath.

## 🐙 Tabbed SPA Layout

The dashboard is now organized as a tabbed SPA with URL-backed hash routes:

- `#monitoring`
- `#ip-bans`
- `#status`
- `#config`
- `#tuning`

Behavior:
- Selected tab is reflected in the URL hash.
- Reload preserves the selected tab.
- Keyboard navigation is supported on tabs (`Left`, `Right`, `Home`, `End`).
- Tab panels expose explicit loading/empty/error states.

Refresh model:
- Polling is scoped to the active tab only.
- One bounded timer is used (no per-tab timer accumulation).
- Polling pauses while the page is hidden and resumes on visibility restore.
- Default cadence: `Monitoring=30s`, `IP Bans=45s`, `Status/Config/Tuning=60s`.
- Monitoring auto-refresh uses a single consolidated read per cycle (`/admin/monitoring`) and updates Monitoring summary/helper panels without triggering multi-endpoint fan-out.
- Monitoring manual/initial refresh still performs full-detail reads (`analytics`, `events`, `bans`, `maze`, `cdp`, `cdp/events`, `monitoring`) to keep charts/tables fully hydrated.
- Monitoring events/CDP tables now use keyed row patching with bounded row windows (`events<=100`, `cdp<=500`) to avoid full-table DOM rebuild churn on refresh.
- Runtime telemetry now captures:
- refresh fetch latency (last/rolling avg/p95/max over a bounded sample window),
- render timing to next frame (last/rolling avg/p95/max over a bounded sample window),
- polling skip/resume counters and last skip/resume reasons.

## 🐙 SvelteKit Runtime

- Dashboard UI is now generated by SvelteKit (`adapter-static`) and served from `dist/dashboard`.
- Route contracts are preserved:
- `/dashboard/index.html`
- `/dashboard/login.html`
- Existing tab hash routes (`#monitoring`, `#ip-bans`, `#status`, `#config`, `#tuning`).
- The page is now a Svelte component tree (`Monitoring`, `IP Bans`, `Status`, `Config`, `Tuning`) instead of shell-fragment injection.
- Runtime behavior mounts through `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-runtime.js` (`mount`/`unmount`) with explicit lifecycle cleanup.
- Svelte-native orchestration (`src/lib/state/dashboard-store.js`, `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-effects.js`, `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-actions.js`) is the canonical runtime path for tab lifecycle, hash sync, polling, and auth/session flow.
- Native action side-effects (login redirect path and tab-focus target lookup) are now routed through `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-effects.js` adapters instead of direct DOM/window reads in action pipelines.
- Dashboard tab/session orchestration helpers are centralized in `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-runtime-orchestration.js`, and config dirty-check orchestration is centralized in `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-runtime-config-dirty.js` and delegated from `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-native-runtime.js`.
- Chart runtime lifecycle is module-scoped through `modules/services/chart-runtime-adapter.js` (lazy load, singleton guard, teardown on final unmount) instead of static head-script injection.
- `dashboard/package.json` still sets `"type": "module"` so existing dashboard module unit tests run via native ESM in Node.

## 🐙 Features

Stats:
- Total bans
- Active bans
- Total events
- Unique IPs
- Test mode banner
- Fail-open/closed indicator (read-only)

Charts:
- Event types distribution (doughnut)
- Top IPs by activity (bar)
- Events over time (line, 60m/24h/7d/30d)
- Local chart runtime renders legends and readable axes/ticks (no CDN dependency)

Tables:
- Current bans (IP, reason, timestamps, signal badges, expandable fingerprint details, quick unban)
- Recent events (type, IP, timestamp, reason)
- CDP detections & bans table (time-windowed CDP-only feed)
- CDP cumulative totals (all-time detections + auto-bans)
- Monitoring summaries:
- Honeypot Hits (total hits, unique crawler buckets, top crawlers, top paths)
- Challenge Failures (reason breakdown + trend)
- PoW Failures (reason breakdown + trend)
- Rate Limiting Violations (total, offenders, outcomes)
- GEO Violations (actions + top countries)
- Prometheus helper panel (examples and guidance sourced from `/admin/monitoring` payload as the single contract source, including explicit `/metrics` semantics, `/admin/monitoring?hours=1-720&limit=1-50` bounded-query examples, sample text output, stat-extraction snippets, and copy actions for JS and curl examples with links to observability/API docs)
- Runtime Variable Inventory tables in Status tab:
- full runtime config snapshot (including nested keys)
- grouped by concern for faster operator scanning
- admin-writable variables highlighted with row background
- per-variable meaning text so operators can read value + intent in one place
- Runtime Performance Telemetry panel in Status tab:
- fetch latency and render timing cards (last + rolling avg + p95 + bounded window/total sample counts)
- polling skip/resume counters with last skip reason and resume timestamp
- operator thresholds: keep rolling p95 fetch latency below `500 ms`, rolling p95 render timing below `16 ms`, and investigate sustained polling skip/resume churn.

Controls:
- Test mode toggle
- Manual ban/unban
- JS Required enforcement toggle
- Rate limit (requests/minute) config
- Honeypot controls (`honeypot_enabled`, `honeypots`)
- Browser policy rule editors (`browser_block`, `browser_whitelist`)
- Bypass allowlist editors (`whitelist`, `path_whitelist`)
- Per-trigger ban durations, including CDP automation duration (`ban_durations.cdp`)
- robots.txt configuration
- CDP detection controls
- PoW enable toggle plus difficulty/TTL tuning
- Challenge puzzle controls (`challenge_puzzle_enabled`, `challenge_puzzle_transform_count`)
- Botness scoring controls:
- challenge threshold
- maze threshold
- per-signal weights (`js_required`, `geo_risk`, `rate_medium`, `rate_high`)
- read-only terminal signal catalog
- editable when `SHUMA_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=true`
- GEO policy controls:
- risk scoring countries (`geo_risk`)
- tiered routing countries (`geo_allow`, `geo_challenge`, `geo_maze`, `geo_block`)
- maze stats
- non-operational Maze Preview link in Maze config
- Enter key submits inputs (API key, ban, unban)
- Active-tab scoped auto-refresh (no background full-dashboard refresh on hidden tabs)
- API client defensively parses JSON-shaped payloads even when upstream omits `Content-Type`, to prevent false empty-state rendering
- Advanced Config JSON editor:
- prefilled with a writable-key template from current config snapshot
- accepts JSON object patch and submits directly to `POST /admin/config`
- dirty-state + validation guarded (save enabled only for valid changed JSON)

## 🐙 Access

Development:
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard/index.html`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard` (canonical redirect to `/dashboard/index.html`)
- Dashboard assets are built via `pnpm run build:dashboard` and emitted to `dist/dashboard` (wired into `make dev`, `make run`, and `make build`).
- API key source: `SHUMA_API_KEY` from environment (local dev commonly loads this from `.env.local`)
- Login flow: unauthenticated visits to `/dashboard/index.html` are redirected to `/dashboard/login.html`; enter API key once to create a short-lived same-origin admin session cookie
- Admin API endpoint is inferred from the page origin (same-origin only)
- `make dev` applies local-write defaults (`DEV_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=true`) even when `.env.local` is stricter.
- Override dev defaults per run if you want production-like read-only behavior (example: `make dev DEV_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=false`).

Production (recommended):
- Protect the dashboard with auth
- Use `SHUMA_ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` to restrict admin access
- Serve over HTTPS
- Store secrets in your platform’s secret store

## 🐙 Event Retention

Event log retention is controlled by `SHUMA_EVENT_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS` (default: `168`). Set to `0` to disable cleanup.

## 🐙 Data Flow (High Level)

1. SvelteKit renders the dashboard page from `src/routes/+page.svelte` with dedicated tab components.
2. On route mount, `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-runtime.js` mounts `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-native-runtime.js` as a single native runtime path (no compatibility flag matrix).
3. Svelte-native orchestrators (`src/lib/state/dashboard-store.js`, `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-effects.js`, `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-actions.js`) own active-tab state, hash/keyboard navigation, session bootstrap, logout, and polling cadence.
4. `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-native-runtime.js` provides reusable runtime adapters (refresh/session/config wiring) and explicit lifecycle entrypoints (`mountDashboardApp()` / `unmountDashboardApp()`), delegating tab/session orchestration to `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-runtime-orchestration.js` and config dirty-check orchestration to `src/lib/runtime/dashboard-runtime-config-dirty.js`.
5. Domain modules (`modules/api-client.js`, `modules/dashboard-state.js`, `modules/monitoring-view.js`, `modules/tables-view.js`, `modules/config-controls.js`, etc.) continue to enforce behavior contracts.
6. Login is Svelte-native in `src/routes/login.html/+page.svelte` (no shell injection/bridge).
7. `adapter-static` writes final static assets to `dist/dashboard`, which Spin serves for `/dashboard/...`.

## 🐙 Local Asset Provenance

Chart runtime is vendored locally to avoid runtime CDN dependency and supply-chain variability:

- Asset: `dashboard/static/assets/vendor/chart-lite-1.0.0.min.js`
- Version: `chart-lite-1.0.0`
- SHA-256: `5eec3d4b98e9ddc1fb88c44e0953b8bded137779a4d930c6ab2647a431308388`
- Policy: update only via reviewed commit; recompute SHA-256 and update this section when changed.

## 🐙 Rollback Notes

This is a pre-launch hard cutover: no archived legacy dashboard runtime is retained in-tree.

If a regression appears, use a normal source rollback path (revert offending commit(s), then run `make test` and `make build` before deploy).

Note: `SHUMA_KV_STORE_FAIL_OPEN` is an environment-level policy and is shown read-only in the dashboard.
Note: Admin config panes are editable only when `SHUMA_ADMIN_CONFIG_WRITE_ENABLED=true`.
Note: PoW config changes are logged to the event log as admin actions.
Note: Botness scoring changes are logged as `botness_config_update` admin actions.
