# 🐙 Shuma-Gorath

A Chaos Dimension Bot Defence for Spin. [Shuma-Gorath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuma-Gorath) is a WebAssembly bot defence that detects, blocks, and monitors automated abuse with honeypots, rate limiting, JS challenges, CDP signals, a maze, and a real-time admin dashboard.

Shuma-Gorath is designed to **complement enterprise bot defenses** (such as [Akamai Bot Manager](https://www.akamai.com/products/bot-manager_) as a second-layer of application-specific protection, but it can also run standalone.

## 🐙 Quickstart (Official)

```bash
# One-time setup (installs Rust, Spin, cargo-watch)
make setup

# Show the local dashboard login key generated by setup
make api-key-show

# If commands are missing, open a new terminal or run:
# source ~/.zshrc

# Start the dev server (official path)
make dev
```

Dashboard:
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard/index.html`

Notes:
- Run setup in an interactive terminal (it may prompt for sudo to install Spin).
- `make setup` creates `.env.local` (gitignored) and auto-generates local dev secrets.
- Use the Makefile for all build/run/test flows.

## 🐙 Common Commands

```bash
make dev              # Start dev server with file watching
make test             # Full suite: unit + integration + dashboard e2e (requires running server)
make test-unit        # Unit tests only
make test-integration # Integration tests (requires running server)
make stop             # Stop Spin server
make status           # Check server status
make api-key-show     # Show local dashboard login key from .env.local
make help             # Show all commands
```

## 🐙 Configuration

- Full, canonical variable reference (env-only keys + KV tunables): `docs/configuration.md`
- Env-only override source: `.env.local` (generated by `make setup`, gitignored)
- Canonical defaults (seeded into KV): `config/defaults.env`
- Supported env-only overrides helper: `make env-help`

Deployment policy note: `SHUMA_KV_STORE_FAIL_OPEN` is a critical choice (fail-open vs fail-closed) when the KV store is unavailable. See `docs/security-hardening.md` and `docs/deployment.md`.
